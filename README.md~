2WeekCancerClassification
=========================

Project files for cancer classification using spectroscopic data.

JOE:

I seem to have a 0.96

To run the trained module on a validation set, DATA.txt with truth labels LABELS.txt:
>> python src/msDetect.py DATA.txt 10000 False output/cancer_train.pkl LABELS.txt

e.g., to run on the training set:
>> python src/msDetect.py sample_data/cancer_train.data 10000 False output/cancer_train.pkl sample_data/cancer_train.labels

To train a ML model I did the following:
1. Center, scale and log() each feature to best approximate a normal distribution. Save the scaling.

2. Convert the features to Vowpal Wabbit formatting
>> python py2vw.py

3. Run Vowpal Wabbit's logistic regression with L1 regularization model to rank the 10k features:
To install Vowpal Wabbit on MacOSx see the instructions at:

Please find a detailed description of VW at:
https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki/using-vw-varinfo

I ran the command:
>> vw-varinfo -c -k --passes 13 --l1 0.00001 sample_data/vw_train_n_l > output/varinfo_l1_l.txt
output/varinfo_l1_l.txt has a list of all 10k features, ranked by RelScore.

4. I extract the 1000 features with the largest positive and 1000 features with the smallest negatvie RelScore
(i.e., correlates with +/- labels the most)

5. I run a linear SVM with GridsearchCV on these 2k features
